        <p>Hey Guys! I'm Ravi Makwana.</p>
        <p>
          I made this website for personal blogging about topics that might
          interest people around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          The website is currently limited to just me posting blogs, but in
          future, the creater version of the same website will allow anyone to
          upload their own blog posts! Sounds amazing right?
        </p>

        <p>
          Do consider sharing this website with your friends, and help me make
          this an amazing blog website!
        </p>
        <p>Cheers! Have a great day.</p>
